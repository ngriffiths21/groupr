Description: The 'groupr' package provides a more powerful version of grouped
  tibbles from 'dplyr'. It allows groups to be marked inapplicable,
  which is a simple but widely useful way to express structure in a dataset.
  It also provides powerful pivoting and other group manipulation functions.
